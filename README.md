Pros of TDD:
- The TDD will help the developer to better sepearate their code, optimize the archetechture so that each part of the code can be tested.
- The TDD will help the refactorization of the code. The developer will know if the part of the code just get refactored is operating correctly or not. This gives developer the confidence of the code after refactorization.
- The TDD will also help the collaboration between the team members. Since the unit test is made, the other team member can edit your code as long as the unit test is passed after edit. 
- The TDD can help the developer find the bug at the early stage of development.
- The TDD can imporve the readability of the code since the reader will know what each part of the code is doing by looking at the role it perform in the test

Cons of TDD:
- It requires the developer to add the test at the beginning which slows down the development process.
- It is hard to write the tests that can cover all scenario. The test might give a misunderstanding of the developer that the code can work in all scenario even though it doesn't cover all of them.
- The test itself cost effort and time to maintain. When the structure, for example, input and output, of the unit has changed, the test will also need to be updated.
