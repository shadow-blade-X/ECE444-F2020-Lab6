Pros of TDD:
- The TDD will help the developer to better sepearate their code, optimize the archetechture so that each part of the code can be tested.
- The TDD will help the refactorization of the code. The developer will know if the part of the code just get refactored is operating correctly or not. This gives developer the confidence of the code after refactorization.
- The TDD will also help the collaboration between the team members. Since the unit test is made, the other team member can edit your code as long as the unit test is passed after edit.
